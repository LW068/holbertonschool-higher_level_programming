# 0x00-javascript-warm_up

## Description:

In this JavaScript warm-up project, I focused on learning the fundamentals of the language, such as creating and running scripts, declaring variables and constants, understanding data types, controlling program flow with if and if...else statements, using loops, creating and using functions, and working with objects and arrays. This project helped me solidify my knowledge of JavaScript and prepared me for more advanced topics and projects in the future.
