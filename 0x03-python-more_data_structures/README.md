# 0x03-python-more_data_structures

## Description:

Python provides several built-in data structures for storing and manipulating data, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Dictionaries are a type of data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique, they are mutable, and defined using curly braces {} and colons :. Sets are similar to lists and dictionaries, but they store only unique values, they are mutable, defined using curly braces {} and are commonly used for membership testing and removing duplicate items.
