# 0x04-python-classes

## Description:

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). Classes define the structure of an object, while objects are instances of a class and have their own unique state. Classes allow for encapsulation and abstraction, enabling code reusability and organization. Classes can also have special methods, such as the constructor method __init__, that are automatically called when a new object is created, and class variables that are shared by all instances of the class.
