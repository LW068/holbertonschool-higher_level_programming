# 0x01-javascript_objects_scopes_closures

## Description:

In this project, we'll dive deeper into JavaScript by exploring objects, scopes, and closures. We'll learn about object-oriented programming in JavaScript, the importance of variable types and scopes, and how to create and use objects and classes in ES6. Additionally, we'll gain a better understanding of prototypes, inheritance, and closures, which are essential concepts for writing efficient and maintainable JavaScript.
