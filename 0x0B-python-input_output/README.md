## Description:

In Python, JSON data can be read from and written to files or other sources such as networks or databases. The json module in Python provides functions for working with JSON data. To convert a Python data structure to a JSON string, use the json.dumps() function. To convert a JSON string to a Python data structure, use the json.loads() function. The resulting data structures can be used like any other Python data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and more.
