# 0x06-python-more_classes

## Description:

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). Objects are instances of a class and can be created by calling the class as if it were a function. Classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and they allow for modular and reusable code. The class defines the blueprint and objects are instances of the blueprint.
