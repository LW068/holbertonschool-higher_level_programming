# 0x0B-python-object_relational_mapping

## Description:

The directory "0x0B-python-object_relational_mapping" contains Python scripts that demonstrate how to connect to and interact with a database using object-relational mapping (ORM) techniques. These scripts showcase how to use Python's SQLAlchemy library to create database tables, perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, and execute SQL queries using ORM. The scripts also demonstrate how to handle exceptions and error messages, and provide practical examples of how to apply ORM techniques to real-world scenarios. If you're looking to learn more about ORM and how to use it with Python, this directory is a great resource to explore.
