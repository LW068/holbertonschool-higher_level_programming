# 0x09-python-everything_is_object

## Description:

In Python, everything is an object. This means that all data types, functions, and modules are objects and have properties and methods. Every object has an unique identity, a type, and a value. Classes are used to define new objects, which are called instances. Classes are templates for creating objects, which have the same properties and methods.
