# 0x02-python-data_structures

## Description:

Python has several built-in data structures that are used to store and organize data in a specific way. The most common data structures in Python are lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type and are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified. Tuples are also ordered collections of items but they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified. Sets are unordered collections of unique items and are useful for performing mathematical set operations. Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value. All these data structures are powerful tools that can be used to efficiently solve a variety of programming problems, and are widely used in Python programming.
