# 0x0A-python-inheritance

## Description:

Python inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This allows for code reuse and modularity. The subclass (child class) can also override or extend the methods and attributes of the superclass (parent class). Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and is used to model real-world relationships between objects.
