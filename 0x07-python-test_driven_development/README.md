# 0x07-python-test_driven_development

## Description:

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology in which tests are written for code before the code itself is written. The developer then writes the code to pass the tests, with the goal of creating code that is simple, modular, and easy to understand. In Python, the unittest library is commonly used to write and run tests. The process of TDD can help catch errors early, ensure that the code is working as expected, and improve the overall quality of the codebase.
